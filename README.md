# CPSC 310 Project Repository

UBC is a big place, and involves a large number of people doing a variety of tasks. The goal of this project is to provide a way to perform some of the tasks required to run the university and to enable effective querying of the metadata from around campus. This will involve working with courses, prerequisites, past course averages, room scheduling, and timetable creation.

This will be a full stack web development project split into four sprints. The first three sprints are server-side development using Node. The fourth sprint is client-side development.

Development will be done with TypeScript and the packages and libraries you use will be strictly limited (for the first three sprints). If you do not know TypeScript, you are encouraged to start investigating the language soon. Its syntax is extremely similar to Java so it should be relatively easy to transition to given your prior experience. It is important to note we will spend very little time in lecture and lab teaching this language; you will be expected to learn it on your own time.

All checkpoints will be marked using an automated test suite. The feedback you will receive from this suite will be limited. To succeed at the project you will need to create your own private test suite to further validate each deliverable. Additional details will be available on the AutoTest page.
